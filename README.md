### Disclaimer
While many of these results are fit to be as accurate as possible with F1's 2019 results, there may be some discrepancies or inaccuracies which do not reflect the true results. Within the index file, login information was written within the index file and <b>I would like to acknowledge that this is bad practice for security reasons and only done because the professor requested it.</b>

### Note
Excel and word documents were uploaded to show the planning process of creating this database. These documents alongside the use of myPHPAdmin were used to build a simple database. Our index file will display the top 3 constructors, drivers, all constructors, and all race results.
